## 1. So Many Plots

Your friend is a property tycoon and owns many plots of a given area.

However, he wants to merge the plots to make one big plot, for which he goes to an Agent.

The agent tells him that in one operation, any two plots can be merged, and in return, he will receive one plot of are $A_x + A_y$ (where $A_x$ and $A_y$ are the areas of two plots merged in one operation) and the resulting plot will be added to his inventory of plots again, but the cost of one operation is equal to the merged area i.e. $Cost = A_x + A_y$.

This operation can be performed until he is left with one plot.

**Help him merge the plots such that in the end, he is left with one plot whose are is the sum of the all his current plots, but the cost shall remain minimum.**

Also, let him know if it is profitable to merge the plots.

You are given the cost per unit area of each plot.

**The total cost of the plots** = $\sum$ Area $\times$ cost per unit area

**He considers it profitable to merge them if the cost to merge the plots is less than the total cost of the plots.**
